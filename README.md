# JavaFX GUI Builder with BlueJ Integration

This project was originally developed by 3 students at the University of Kent with the purpose of creating a JavaFX based solution to GUI Building. Our aim was to create a Graphical User Interface builder that would aid in the teaching of fundamental graphical programming concepts to beginners, to produce useable, human-readable code and integrate seamlessly with BlueJ.

The builder produces both FXML code and pure JavaFX implementations so that comparisons can be made between the two models.
